## RO SELECTED

Based on the water analysis report, the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) level is extremely high at 18,810 mg/l, and the Chloride level is 8,830 mg/l. This water quality falls into the seawater category (TDS > 10,000 ppm). Therefore, a **Dayliff Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) Plant** is required. The user requires a capacity of 0.5 m³/hr (500 L/hr). We recommend a model capable of handling the high salinity and producing the required permeate flow, designated here as **DRO-SW-0.5** (representing a 0.5 m³/hr Seawater RO unit). This unit will utilize SWRO membranes designed for high rejection at high pressures (typically 40-70 bar) and include the necessary high-pressure pump and control system. Specific model details should be confirmed with Davis & Shirtliff as SWRO units are often customized or special order.

## Pretreatment

The raw water requires extensive pretreatment to protect the SWRO membranes from scaling, fouling, and clogging, ensuring optimal performance and longevity.

1.  **Raw Water Pumping:** A **Dayliff DDC 158** centrifugal pump will draw water from the source (shallow well/borehole) and provide adequate pressure for the subsequent treatment stages.
2.  **Oxidation:** Due to elevated Iron (0.18 mg/l), Manganese (0.17 mg/l), and very high Copper (4.18 mg/l), oxidation is necessary. We recommend dosing **Sodium Hypochlorite (Liquid Chlorine)** using a **Seko AML 200** dosing pump from a **60L Dayliff Chemical Dosing Tank**. This will oxidize the dissolved metals into filterable precipitates and provide initial disinfection. A contact tank (sized based on flow rate and required contact time) might be needed after injection.
3.  **Multimedia Filtration (MMF):** A **Dayliff CXD 400 GRP filter vessel** with an **Automatic backwash valve**, filled with **Filter Glass Media**, will remove suspended solids (TSS: 8 mg/l), reduce turbidity (6.0 NTU), and filter out the precipitated Iron, Manganese, and Copper oxides.
4.  **Activated Carbon Filtration (ACF):** A second **Dayliff CXD 400 GRP filter vessel** with an **Automatic backwash valve**, filled with **Activated Carbon Media**, is crucial to remove the residual chlorine dosed for oxidation, as chlorine damages RO membranes. It also removes potential organic compounds and improves taste/odor.
5.  **Dechlorination (Safety Step):** To ensure complete chlorine removal before the RO membranes, **Sodium Metabisulphite (SMBS)** should be dosed using a **Seko AML 200** dosing pump from a **60L Dayliff Chemical Dosing Tank**.
6.  **Antiscalant Dosing:** The water has extremely high hardness (3250 mg/l as CaCO3 from high Ca & Mg) and high sulphate (1440 mg/l), leading to a very high scaling potential on the RO membranes, especially at high recovery rates typical of SWRO. Dosing a potent antiscalant suitable for seawater/high TDS is mandatory. We recommend **Genesys LF** (or equivalent confirmed by simulation), dosed using a precise **Grundfos Alldos DDE 6-10** digital dosing pump from a **60L Dayliff Chemical Dosing Tank**. Accurate dosage calculation using supplier software (like Genesys MM5) is highly recommended.
7.  **Cartridge Filtration:** A final safety filtration step using an **Atlas Filtri DP 20 MONO housing** with a **5-micron CPP sediment cartridge** will remove any fine particles that may have passed the media filters or originated from the dosing systems, protecting the high-pressure RO pump and membranes.

## Posttreatment

RO permeate water is typically pure but has low pH and lacks minerals, requiring conditioning for domestic use.

1.  **pH Correction:** The RO permeate will likely be acidic. To raise the pH to acceptable levels for domestic use (preventing corrosion and improving taste), **Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic Soda)** should be dosed using a **Seko AML 200** dosing pump from a **60L Dayliff Chemical Dosing Tank**.
2.  **Disinfection:** As a final barrier against any potential microbial contamination post-RO or in the storage tank, UV sterilization is recommended. A **Dayliff DUV-C3 UV Sterilizer** provides effective disinfection without adding chemicals.
3.  **Distribution Pumping (Optional):** Depending on the pressure requirements of the distribution network, a booster pump might be needed after the permeate storage tank. A **Dayliff Aquastrong SMART45** variable speed pump can provide constant pressure on demand.
